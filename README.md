# React TodoList

This is a simple Todo List application built using React. It allows you to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. You can also create sub-items by starting a task with `>`. The completed tasks are marked with a checkbox.

## Features

- Add tasks to your list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Create sub-items using `>`.
- Smooth scrolling to the bottom of the list when a new task is added.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the TodoList application.

## Usage

- To add a new task, type the task text in the input field and click the "+" button or press Enter.
- To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task.
- To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.
